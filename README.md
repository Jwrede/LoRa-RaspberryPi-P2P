# LoRa-RaspberryPi-P2P
A fork of https://github.com/Wei1234c/SX127x_driver_for_MicroPython_on_ESP8266 that picks out the parts for Send and Receive for two Raspberry Pi's

The Pins I use are:

DIO0 -> 5\
DIO1 -> 6\
Reset -> 22\
SCK -> 11\
MISO -> 9\
MOSI-> 10\
NSS -> 8 (CE0)\
(can be changed in `controller.py`)
